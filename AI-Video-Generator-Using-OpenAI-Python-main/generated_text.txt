Rap music is a genre of popular music that developed in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is characterized by a rhythmic vocal style that often includes rhyming lyrics, and is accompanied by beats or a backing track. Rap music is often associated with hip-hop culture, which is a subculture that originated in the Bronx, New York, in the 1970s. Rap music is heavily influenced by other genres such as funk, soul, and reggae. Its lyrical content often focuses on social issues, such as poverty, violence, and racism. The genre has seen a surge in popularity in recent years, with the rise of artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and Chance the Rapper.
